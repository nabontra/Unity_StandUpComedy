# Unity 5.x - Stand Up Comedy
This virtual space is meant to represent the five minutes before you go on stage at a comedy club and you've forgotten your notes.  Pure stress and anxiety.  Wear headphones for maximum effect!

This was created as part of Episode 4 of the [Opposable Thumbs podcast](http://www.opposablepodcast.com/) hosted by [Taylor Hokanson](http://taylorhokanson.com/) and [Rob Ray](http://robray.net/).  For the Mac version, you will need to right-click/control-click the unzipped file and say "open" for the first run.  It will ask you if you are sure, because it is not coming from the App Store.
